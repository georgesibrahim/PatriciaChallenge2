# Patricia — 5K Achievement Page

Static site for: **Step Ahead with G — Legends Never Jog**  
Milestone: Challenge #2 — 5 km in 32 minutes

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo (public) on GitHub, for example `patricia-5k`.
2. Copy the contents of this folder to the repo (keep the `index.html` at the root).
3. Commit and push.
4. In the repo **Settings → Pages**, set:
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `main` (root)
5. Wait for Pages to publish. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Customization
- Update the date in the certificate by editing the `index.html` value in: `<span id="achieved-date">[...]</span>`.
- Replace/add images in `assets/images/` and update the Gallery list if needed.
- If you want the page to also act like a "series" index, duplicate this page for each milestone and link them from a top-level `index.html`.

Enjoy!
